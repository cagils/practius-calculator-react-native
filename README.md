NOTE: This is currently functional but unpolished WIP.
 
Some best practices and patterns currently implemented are:

 - ES6 arrow functions to auto-bind
 - Container components and functional presentation/view components
 - Functional state (decoupled state changes)
 - Use of package.json to simplify imports
 - Use of propTypes and defaultProps
 - Practical folder structure optimized for developer time
 
..Additional information will be added..
